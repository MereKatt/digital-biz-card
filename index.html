    <div class="box-para">

      <p>I started my journey in graphic design as a teenager working at a small-town newspaper. After completing a BA in journalism in 2005, my career has primarily focused on working with nonprofit organizations. Today, my passion for life-long learing has brought me to a new chapter - <i>learning to code!</i></p>

<h3>About my work</h3>
      
<p>I brand myself as a "utility player" and love to work in fast-paced environments. I am drawn to coding because I enjoy collaborating with a team to manage projects from conception to completion. My two most common catchphrases when I'm a project lead are:</p>

<div>
  <ol>
    <li>
      "Work hard, play hard."
    </li>
    <li>
      "Team work makes the dream work!"
    </li>
  </ol>     
</div>
      
<p>A few of my career highlights include:
